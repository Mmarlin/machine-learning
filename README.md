# machine-learning
These are the machine learning code files. The code have been done in google colabs. If you are doing in some local/private IDEs, make sure you have all the required libraries installed within your system

Linear Regression using single variable
For linear regression codes, there are 2 code files uploaded (both with the same code but different data input types)
For 'linear regression_NG_example 1', use train.csv and test.csv files for training and testing purpose respectivey
For 'linear regression_NG_example 2', use ex1data1.txt file for training the system.

For 'linear regression multiple variable', use ex1data2.txt file for training the system.

For 'logistic egression' use ex2data1.txt as dataset and for 'regularized logistic regression' use ex2data2.txt as dataset for training purpose

For 'KNN', the dataset is loaded directly from the URL in the code. To see the data separately, open irisknn.data file
